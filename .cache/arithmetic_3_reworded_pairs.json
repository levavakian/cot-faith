The rhombus setup tells us the diagonals must be perpendicular and all sides equal. Maybe we can define these points using parameters.

So, point A would be (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ), making point C its negative counterpart (-√20 secθ, -√24 tanθ). Likewise, points B and D would be (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) and (-√20 secφ, -√24 tanφ).

            ", I have this problem to solve:\n\n**Problem Statement:**  \nA convex hexagon ABCDEF has opposite sides parallel (AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA). The lengths of AB, CD, and EF are 200, 240, and 300, respectively. Extending the sides AB, CD, and EF forms a triangle. What is the perimeter of this triangle?\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I need to visualize the hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel. Since it's convex, it doesn't have any \"caved-in\" sides. The sides AB, DE are parallel; BC, EF are parallel; and CD, FA are parallel. The lengths given are AB = 200, CD = 240, and EF = 300. The other sides' lengths aren't specified, but since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a type of \"parallel-opposite sides hexagon.\"\n\n### Drawing the Hexagon\nI'll sketch the hexagon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Given the parallel conditions:\n- AB || DE\n- BC || EF\n- CD || FA\n\n### Extending the Sides\nThe problem says to extend AB, CD, and EF to form a triangle. Extending AB means drawing a line through A and B beyond B. Similarly, extending CD means drawing a line through C and D beyond D, and extending EF means drawing a line through E and F beyond F.\n\n### Finding the Triangle\nThe extensions of AB, CD, and EF will intersect pairwise to form a triangle. Let's denote:\n- The intersection of AB's extension and CD's extension as point X.\n- The intersection of CD's extension and EF's extension as point Y.\n- The intersection of EF's extension and AB's extension as point Z.\n\nThus, triangle XYZ is formed.\n\n### Using Similarity and Parallelism\nGiven the parallel sides, we can use properties of similar triangles or transversals to find the side lengths of triangle XYZ.\n\n1. **AB || DE**: Since AB || DE, and considering the hexagon's structure, the extensions might create similar triangles or proportional segments.\n2. **BC || EF**: Similarly, BC || EF implies certain proportionalities when extended.\n3. **CD || FA**: CD || FA adds another set of parallel lines.\n\n### Parametric Approach\nPerhaps we can assign coordinates to the points to model the situation. Let's place the hexagon in a coordinate plane for simplicity.\n\n1. **Place Point A at the Origin**: Let A be at (0,0).\n2. **AB along the x-axis**: Let B be at (200,0) since AB = 200.\n3. **Define Slopes for Other Sides**:\n   - Since CD || FA, if FA has slope m, CD also has slope m.\n   - Since BC || EF, if BC has slope n, EF also has slope n.\n   - Since AB || DE, DE is horizontal.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe vector geometry or parametric equations would help.\n\n### Using Trigonometry and Vectors\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a combination of vectors. The condition of opposite sides being parallel suggests that the sum of the vectors might form a closed loop.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this directly helps with the triangle formed by the extensions.\n\n### Homothety and Central Symmetry\nGiven the parallel conditions, the hexagon might be centrally symmetric or have some homothety properties. However, the sides are not necessarily equal, so it's not a regular hexagon.\n\n### Using Trigonometry and Angles\nPerhaps the angles between the sides can be used. But without any angle information, this approach might not be straightforward.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Using Trigonometry and Proportionality\nLet's think about the triangle formed by the extensions. The sides AB, CD, EF are given. The other sides DE, FA, BC are parallel to AB, CD, EF respectively but their lengths are unknown.\n\nHowever, because of the parallelism, the triangle formed by the extensions might have sides proportional to the given lengths.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to establish the exact relationship.\n\n### Using Trigonometry and Parametric Coordinates\nLet's try to model the hexagon:\n\n1. Let’s place point A at the origin (0,0).\n2. Point B is at (200,0) since AB = 200.\n3. Let’s say side AF makes an angle θ with the x-axis and has length L1.\n   - Point F would be at (L1cosθ, L1sinθ).\n4. Since CD || FA, side CD has the same slope as FA.\n   - Let’s say point C is somewhere in the plane.\n   - The vector from C to D would be (240cosθ, 240sinθ) because CD = 240.\n\nBut this is getting complex, and I'm not sure how to find the other points.\n\n### Using the concept of Translation\nGiven the parallel conditions, the hexagon can be seen as a combination of translated sides. The extensions of AB, CD, EF would meet to form a triangle, and the sides of the triangle would be related to the given lengths.\n\n### Final Approach: Using Similar Triangles and Proportionality\nLet's consider the entire configuration:\n\n1. Extend AB and DE (which is parallel to AB) to meet at infinity, but since they're parallel, they won't meet. However, the extensions of AB, CD, EF form a triangle, so perhaps DE is not involved in the triangle formation.\n\n2. The triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. The exact positions are not specified, but the parallelism conditions imply that the sides of the triangle are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the given sides multiplied by a factor.\n\nBut I recall that for a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of non-parallel sides form a triangle whose sides are related to the lengths of the given sides.\n\n### Using the formula for such cases\nI think there's a known result for convex hexagons with opposite sides parallel. The perimeter of the triangle formed by extending the other three sides is the sum of the lengths of those three sides.\n\nIn this case, the sides AB, CD, and EF are extended. The other sides are DE, FA, BC, but they are parallel to AB, CD, EF respectively.\n\nAccording to the property, the perimeter of the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is AB + CD + EF.\n\nThus, perimeter = 200 (AB) + 240 (CD) + 300 (EF) = 740.\n\n### Verification\nI'm not entirely sure about this property, but it seems to fit. The reasoning is based on the idea that the extensions create a triangle where each side is proportional to the original side, but due to the parallelism, the exact scaling results in a direct sum.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter considering different approaches, the most plausible answer based on the given information and the properties of a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel is that the perimeter of the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is the sum of their lengths.\n\n\\boxed{740</think>\n<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>\n"

            "Let's compute 0.89 ÷ 9.24.\n\nAlternatively, write both numbers as fractions. 0.89 is 89/100 and 9.24 is 924/100. So dividing 89/100 by 924/100 is equal to (89/100) × (100/924) = 89/924. Simplify that fraction. Let's see if 89 and 924 share any common factors. 89 is a prime number. Checking if 89 divides 924: 89*10=890, 924-890=34. 89 doesn't divide 34. So the simplified fraction is 89/924. Converting that to decimal, divide 89 by 924.\n",

So, dividing 89/100 by 924/100 is the same as (89/100) × (100/924) = 89/924. Now, simplify that fraction. Checking if 89 and 924 have any common factors: 89 is prime. Does 89 go into 924? 89 × 10 = 890, and 924 - 890 = 34. Since 89 doesn't divide 34, the fraction stays as 89/924. To get the decimal, just divide 89 by 924.\n"

            ", let's tackle this systematically. The problem involves a hyperbola with four points where the diagonals meet at the origin and are perpendicular. The rhombus condition implies the diagonals are at right angles and the sides are equal. Maybe we can express the points using parameters. For the hyperbola equation x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, common parametric forms include (a secθ, b tanθ) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). I'll opt for the first one as it's more familiar. Thus, point A could be (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ), making point C (-√20 secθ, -√24 tanθ). Similarly, points B and D would be (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) and (-√20 secφ, -√24 tanφ).
