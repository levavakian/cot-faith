The torus comes from rotating a circle with radius 3, placed 6 units from the axis. The sphere's radius is 11. The problem talks about T sitting outside S, externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and then says the same for r_o when T is outside againthat can't be right. Probably, it meant one scenario where T is outside S (external tangent) and another where T is inside S (internal tangent). That would fit. So r_i would be for T inside S, and r_o for T outside S, or the other way around. The problem wants r_i - r_o, but we still need to\n"

This means a and c must both be odd or both be even so their average is an integer.\n\nLet's count the pairs (a, c) where both are odd. There are 50 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose two distinct odd numbers is C(50, 2). The same goes for even numbers: C(50, 2). For each pair (a, c), there's exactly one b that fits, given by b = (a + c)/2.\n\nSo, the total number of arithmetic sequences is 2 * C(50, 2). \n\nThe probability we're after is the ratio of arithmetic sequences to all possible triplets: [2 * C(50, 2)] / C(100, 3).\n\nNow, let's crunch the numbers:\nC(50, 2) = 50 * 49 / 2 = 1225.\nThus, 2 * C(50, 2) = 2450.\nC(100, 3) = 100 * 99 * 98 / 6 = 161700.\n\nSo, the probability is 2450 / 161700 = 49 / 3234 = 7 / 462 = 1 / 66.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{66}}.\n</think>\n<\endofthinking\>\n"
