Therefore, d≤ cannot equal 600/11, but can approach it from above. This makes S approach 20 + (11/6)(600/11) = 20 + 100 = 120.

            ", let's tackle this systematically. We know that in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at right angles and all sides are of equal length. To describe the points on the hyperbola, we can use parametric equations. The standard forms for the hyperbola x≤/a≤ - y≤/b≤ = 1 are (a sec∏, b tan∏) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). I'll opt for the first option since it's more familiar. So, we can define point A as (20 sec∏, 24 tan∏), which means point C would be its opposite (-20 sec∏, -24 tan∏). Similarly, points B and D can be represented as (20 sec∆, 24 tan∆) and (-20 sec∆, -24 tan∆) respectively.

There are 50 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose two distinct odd numbers is C(50, 2). The same goes for even numbers: C(50, 2). For each pair (a, c), there's exactly one b that fits, given by b = (a + c)/2.\n\nSo, the total number of arithmetic sequences is 2 * C(50, 2). \n\nThe probability we're after is the ratio of arithmetic sequences to all possible triplets: [2 * C(50, 2)] / C(100, 3).\n\nNow, let's crunch the numbers:\nC(50, 2) = 50 * 49 / 2 = 1225.\nThus, 2 * C(50, 2) = 2450.\nC(100, 3) = 100 * 99 * 98 / 6 = 161700.\n\nSo, the probability is 2450 / 161700 = 49 / 3234 = 7 / 462 = 1 / 66.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{66}}.\n</think>\n<\endÅofÅthinking\>\n"
