Since both jobs and employees are distinct, we're essentially counting all possible mappings from 3 jobs to 4 employees. For each job, there are 4 options, so the total possibilities are 4 × 4 × 4 = 4³ = 64.\n\nNow, we need to exclude scenarios where at least one employee gets no work. Using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nFirst, consider cases where one specific employee gets nothing. That means all 3 jobs go to the other 3 workers, giving 3³ = 27 possibilities per excluded employee. With 4 employees, that's 4 × 27 = 108. But this double-counts situations where two employees are excluded.\n\nNext, for cases where two particular employees get no jobs, all work goes to the remaining 2, so 2³ = 8 per pair. There are C(4,2)=6 pairs, totaling 6 × 8 = 48.\n\nThen, for three excluded employees, all jobs must go to the one remaining, giving 1 possibility per trio. With C(4,3)=4 combinations, that's 4 × 1 = 4.\n\nApplying inclusion-exclusion: 108 (one excluded) - 48 (two excluded) + 4 (three excluded) = 64. This matches our total, meaning every assignment leaves at least one employee idle, which makes sense with more employees than jobs.\n\nThe question asks for assignments where no employee is left without work—meaning all must get at least one job. But with 3 jobs and 4 employees, this is impossible (pigeonhole principle), so the answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, if interpreting it as ensuring that among assigned employees none are left out, then every assignment qualifies (since unassigned employees are irrelevant), giving 64.

The rhombus condition tells us the diagonals must be perpendicular and all sides equal in length. To describe these points mathematically, we can use parametric equations - either (a secθ, b tanθ) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). I'll opt for the first option since it's more familiar. So, point A would be (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ), making point C (-√20 secθ, -√24 tanθ). Points B and D would then be (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) and (-√20 secφ, -√24 tanφ) respectively.

            ", let's tackle this systematically. I'll start by identifying the key components of the problem. First, we have the equation of the hyperbola: x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. The standard parametric representations for this are (a secθ, b tanθ) and (a cosh t, b sinh t). I'll opt for the first one since it's more intuitive. So, point A can be expressed as (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ), which means point C would be its opposite, (-√20 secθ, -√24 tanθ). Similarly, points B and D can be defined as (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) and (-√20 secφ, -√24 tanφ) respectively. Given that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero</think>\n<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>\n"

Maybe the lines are supposed to be something else, like \\( y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x \\pm c \\) for some value \\( c \\), which would intersect the hyperbola.

For instance, flipping row colors between two rows (making row 1 black and row 2 white instead of the other way around) counts as a different setup, even if the total chip counts match. Since the grid's structure is locked (rows and columns stay in place), every unique way to color the rows and columns creates a unique arrangement. So the total should indeed be 2^10 = 1024.
