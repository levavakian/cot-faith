            ", let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to distribute the 4 distinct gifts among the 3 distinct children, ensuring each child gets at least one gift. Since the gifts and children are distinct, we're dealing with permutations where each gift is assigned to a unique child, and no child is left out.\n\nThe total number of unrestricted distributions is 3^4 = 81, since each of the 4 gifts has 3 choices. However, this includes cases where one or more children receive no gifts. To find the number of valid distributions where every child gets at least one gift, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, subtract the cases where at least one child gets no gift. There are C(3,1) = 3 ways to choose which child gets nothing, and for each such choice, the 4 gifts can be distributed to the remaining 2 children in 2^4 = 16 ways. So, we subtract 3 * 16 = 48 from the total.\n\nBut now, we've subtracted too much because cases where two children get no gifts (and all gifts go to one child) have been subtracted twice. So, we need to add these back. There are C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose which two children get nothing, and for each, the gifts can go to the single remaining child in 1^4 = 1 way. So, we add back 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nThus, the number of valid distributions is 81 - 48 + 3 = 36.\n\nNow, let's verify this using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct objects into k non-empty subsets. Here, we have 4 gifts and 3 children, so we need S(4,3). The Stirling number S(4,3) is 6, which represents the number of ways to partition the 4 gifts into 3 non-empty groups. Since the children are distinct, we then multiply by 3! (the number of ways to assign these 3 groups to the 3 children), giving 6 * 6 = 36, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid distributions is 36. \n\nFinally, since the problem asks for the probability that each child receives at least one gift, we divide the number of valid distributions by the total number of possible distributions: 36 / 81 = 4/9. \n\nSo, the probability is 4/9. \n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}</think>\n<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>\n"

To do this, we'll apply the power rule to each term individually. The power rule states that the derivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( n x^{n-1} \\). \n\nApplying this:\n- The derivative of \\( x^3 \\) is \\( 3x^2 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 2x^2 \\) is \\( 4x \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -5x \\) is \\( -5 \\).\n- The derivative of the constant \\( 1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nNow, combining these results, the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is:\n\\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \\]\n\nNext, to find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n\\[ 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nwhere \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 60}}{6} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{76}}{6} \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{76} = 2\\sqrt{19} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{19}}{6} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the critical points are at:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\]\nand\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\]\n\nFinally, to determine the nature of these critical points (whether they are maxima, minima, or points of inflection), we can use the second derivative test. First, find the second derivative \\( f''(x) \\):\n\\[ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 + 4x - 5) = 6x + 4 \\]\n\nNow, evaluate \\( f''(x) \\) at each critical point:\n1. For \\( x = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\):\n   \\[ f''\\left(\\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{19}}{3}\\right) = 6\\left(\\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{19}}{3}\\right) + 4 = -4 + 2\\sqrt{19} + 4 = 2\\sqrt{19} > 0 \\]\n   Since \\( f''(x) > 0 \\), this critical point is a local minimum.\n\n2. For \\( x = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\):\n   \\[ f''\\left(\\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{19}}{3}\\right) = 6\\left(\\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{19}}{3}\\right) + 4 = -4 - 2\\sqrt{19} + 4 = -2\\sqrt{19} < 0 \\]\n   Since \\( f''(x) < 0 \\), this critical point is a local maximum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1 \\) has:\n- A local maximum at \\( x = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\).\n- A local minimum at \\( x = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{19}}{3} \\)</think>\n<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>\n"
